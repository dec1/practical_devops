### Job
Creates one or more Pods and will continue to restart (can only happend due to container with according to them until success or failure.
- **RestartPolicy**:
    - Coincides (replaces) with position of  RestartPolicy of Pod (in spec) but interpretation is slightly different (cf: [pod restartPolicy](../pod/lifecycle.md))
        - ~~Always~~-  not allowed
        - Never 
            -  (as for individual pod)  **Only**  with this => **can pod fail**
            - but now additionally:
                - pod gets restarted  (max `backoffLimit` times)
           
        - OnFailure - same as  as for individual pod    
            - container gets restarted     
    
##### Cleanup  
-  When a Job completes, no more Pods are created. Deletion of existing:

    - **Manual** - deletes _job_ **and** _pods_ 
    `k delete -f job.yaml`  
    `k delete job my-job`
    - **Automatic**
    `ttlSecondsAfterFinished` see below (Kubernetes **1.24**+ only. Earlier versions dont support automatic deletion)

        - CronJobs clean up automatically (see successfulJobsHistoryLimit, failedJobsHistoryLimit)

<br>

- **Success** 
    - `spec.completions` pods have succeeded (all containers exit `code 0`  see [Pod](../pod/pod.md))

- **Failure**
    - `backoffLimit` -  total Pod failure count exceeds
    - `activeDeadlineSeconds`  - total execution time of all pods
