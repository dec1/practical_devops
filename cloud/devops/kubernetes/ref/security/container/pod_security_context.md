### SecurityContext

- Defines [privilege and access control settings](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-capabilities-for-a-container) for a **Pod or Container**, and enforced by the [container runtime](../../general/architecture/overview.md)

    - eg uid,gid to run init process as, capabilities, gid of mounted filessystems

#####
- can be applied to:
    #####
    - (i) **whole pod** only (ie all containers)
        - `fsGroup`:  the **GID** to assign to any files/dirs in **mounted volumes**  
            - Mounted  volumes are pod wide (shared by containers)

            - _**Overrides**_ the default behaviour (which is to take primary _group id of user_ - which still happens in ephemeral file system of container)

            - _Note_: logically this might be equally well be applied to an individual container too but, limiting its application to pod as a whole, is a design choice of kubernetes
        
    #####
    - (ii) **single container** 
        - `capabilities` - see egs below
        - `allowPrivilegeEscalation` - child process in a container can gain more privileges than its parent (which means ultimately more than init process of container)
        - `privileged`  - containers have much access to host
        
    ####
    - (iii) either **pod or container** (container settings override any set on pod)
        - `runAsUser `:  **UID** to run the container process as. Overrides any `USER` in dockerfile
        - `runAsGroup`: **GID** .... 
        - `runAsNonRoot`: prevents pod running if USER (or runAsUser) is root
