### PKI

Set of roles, policies, hardware, software and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store and revoke digital certificates and (both private and public keys of) public-key encryption keys.



- ##### SSL (now TLS)
    - authentication and encryption [uses](./tls_ssl.md)
        - **Certs** (which include public key along with other information).
            - for each (public) cert is an associated private keys.
            - the additional cert overhead makes TLS more complicated than SSH (which is why applications like git prefer ssh)

        - **Client verification**
            -  optional - and not using  makes TSL vulnerable to man-in-middle attacks (see below)
            - using certs for clients is uncommon (troublesome in web browser setting).
                - Alternatives:
                    - Passed by client in http `Authorization` header of `every call` :

                        - **Bearer Tokens** (eg **JWT**, **OAuth**). 
                            - composed of {**header**, **payload**, **signature**} 
                            - created (and signed with key) independently of TLS session :
                                #####
                                ```http
                                ...
                                Authorization: Bearer <service-account-token>
                                ...
                                ```

                        - **Basic Authentication** (username and password) 

                            - **base64** encoded `username:password` 
                                #####
                                ```http
                                ...
                                Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpwQDU1dzByZA==
                                ...
                                ```
            
- PGP
- S/MIME

- ##### SSH
    - authentication and encryption [uses](./ssh.md)
        -  **key pairs** (public and private keys)

### man-in-middle:
- can occur when both parties are not verified.
    - SSH: requires mutual verification, and as such is not very susceptible
    - **TSL**: client verification optional, which makes it more **susceptible**
