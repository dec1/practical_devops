### API Gateway

The consolidates everything (cross-cutting) needed for reliable and secure network access (cross-cutting concerns such as load balancing, authentication, rate limiting, request/response transformation, and logging) not specific to any single application (which can then concentrate on implementing the business logic). 

Often a single api gateway sits in front of many (independent) applications. 
Clients can access different, independent APIs as though they were separate, without being aware of the Gatewayâ€™s presence.


The API Gateway simplifies backend architecture, offloading network-related responsibilities from individual applications, allowing them to focus solely on implementing business logic.
